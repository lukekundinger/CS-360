Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The goal was to make a fast and easy way for users to track their weight without distractions. It was designed for people who just want a basic log that’s simple and local to their device.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
I only included one main screen to keep it simple. It has input fields for date and weight, and a history section. The clean layout makes it easy to use, which helps users stay focused on tracking their numbers.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I started small and built up piece by piece, testing each part along the way. Keeping the code organized made it easier to fix bugs and add features later, which is something I’ll keep doing in future projects.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I tested by using the app on the emulator and checking that data saved correctly in the database. It helped me catch layout issues and see how the UI responds, which is important for making sure the app actually works for real users.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I had to figure out how to keep the UI simple while still saving data to SQLite in the background. Keeping things lightweight but functional took a bit of trial and error.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I think the database part came out well. It stores and loads data cleanly, and I didn’t use any extra libraries. I just built it with basic tools, which shows I understand how to manage local storage efficiently.
